Garage Automotive Service is a full-featured front end website developed for a two-wheeler doorstep servicing platform. The project is all about providing a clean, user-friendly, and informative front end website, which informs the customers about the service, instills trust in customers, and also carries out online service booking.

The website has been developed by utilizing HTML5 and CSS3 along with external styling and icons provided by Font Awesome,which is static website along with a  navigational bar, use of social media, and well-organized sections such as how we work, why choose us, service checklist, services offered, about us, gallery, and contact us, etc.

The "How We Work" section clearly outlines the step-by-step process of services provided, while the service checklist provides transparency in that all the processes undertaken during the inspection are outlined. The gallery section provides a visual representation of the services carried out, and the contact form is useful in providing users with an easy way to submit inquiry forms.

This project reveals the strong basics of HTML syntax, layout design, user interface layout, and business website programming, and hence could be considered suitable for academic writing, programming practice, and beginner front-end programming training purposes.
